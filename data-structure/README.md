### Bio O notation
big o notation helps us understand how long an algo will take to run or how much memory it will  need as the amount of data it handle grows.

## O(n)
it means the execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data (n)  

# Example is in big o folder 01

## O(1) 
it means the execution time of an algorithm remains constant 


## O(n^2)
it means the algorithm execution time grows quadratically ==> applicable for nested loops ***

## O(log n)
it means the time complezity of the algorithm runtime grows logarithmitically ==> like if the input size increase then the time taken by the algorithm ti run increases slowly
